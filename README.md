# ONNX-Toolbox
Welcome to the ONNX-Toolbox! This repository is intend to be the swiss knief for ONNX model processing. My goal is to provide a collection of tools and utilities designed to simplify the processing and analysis of ONNX model files. Whether you're working on inspecting model structures, optimizing performance, or debugging issues, I hope this toolbox can provide you some practical solutions for your daily routine.

## ONNX Model Analyzer
This is the first tool that is currently being developed. The tool will provide you some basic graph level analysis of the compute and data transfer cost of the model.
